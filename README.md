# Introduction
A to-do list pwa app inspired by Microsoft Todo.  
The original intention of making this project is because I like Microsoft Todo very much, but I hope to have a more privacy-friendly open source version.   
In order to achieve the compatibility of various operating systems as quickly as possible, it is planned to use the form of PWA, so that it can be close to the native app on both Android and iOS.  
You only need to have a Chrome browser on your computer, and you can also create a shortcut to the PWA application.
